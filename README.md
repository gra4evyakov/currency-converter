# Currency converter
## The second project is designed to convert currencies and display current quotes. This project used a layout template from Bootstrap and an API from the site https://www.cbr-xml-daily.ru /. 
### If you say that I regretted it, it means to say nothing. For some reason, there was no place for bootstrap in my soul. 
### When this project was being written, I had problems editing bootstrap styles, which I tried to change thanks to my meager knowledge. 

### You can take a look at this Frankenstein at the link below.
